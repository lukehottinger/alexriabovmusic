# TRANSIENT

New York. A two bedroom apartment in the heart of Washington Heights. Only by now, it was rented by strangers. We had a baby grand, grand enough to impress anyone brave enough to trek the badlands of upper Manhattan. The hallway separated by a knobless wooden door led to the two rooms that my brother and I spent twenty years of our life. The summer of 2015 was hot and my brother and I shared one room, one futon, holding on to what meant the most to us. Ma and Pa moved back to Saint Petersburg - a failed immigration - not in its physical form - but an emotional undertaking that never fully incorporated them into a life they wanted. We clenched onto the last reminder of a family we once had. It was then that I began to write music.
